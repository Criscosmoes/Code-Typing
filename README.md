### Code-Typing


Code Typing is a place I created where programmers can use to improve their typing speed. Including popular languages like Python, Javascript, etc. 
Go from a complete beginner to an expert typist. I designed this Full-stack app using React/Redux on the Front-end, and Node/Express on the Back-end. 
A user can log in to their google account using Google OAuth and Passport, to further engage with the app. Once logged in, if a user gets a high score,
their score will show on the leaderboard with their name in real time. Try to place number 1!



### Tech Stack

React, React Router, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Node, Express, MongoDB, Passport, Axios
